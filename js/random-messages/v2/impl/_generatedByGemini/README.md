Change the code of the v1 so that:

1. When a tooltip appears (as you said earlier, it is similar to a Tooltip or Toast Notification), then the text that was clicked on disappeared, and several tips appeared, randomly from 1 to 5. The positioning of the first tip should be in place of the text. The second, third, and subsequent tips should appear vertically upwards one above the other. When all tips are closed due to a timeout or manually closed by clicking on the crosses, then the text for clicking and, accordingly, re-displaying the tips should appear again.

2. When the page loads, the tips should first be displayed. After they are closed, the text is displayed, when clicked on which the tips will be displayed again.
